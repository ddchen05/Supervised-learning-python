# Wine quality prediction using different supervised learning algorithms
This repository demonstrates the implemention and optimization of several supervised learning algorithms towards the wine dataset to classify wine. Five supervised 
learning algorithms, including decision trees, neural networks, boosting, support vector machines, and K-nearest neighbors have been implemented. The  performance of 
different algorithms are compared.
